TRUE Automatic Link Exchange / TRUE AUTOMATIC BACKLINK BUILDING 
In this version we have added ability to register and completely install plugin right from your wordpress control panel.
Use this plugin to control all aspects of your link exchange, automatic  backlink generation, regular link exchange,  ABC exchange or link ads (sales and  purchases) and much more. 
We are the only ones that give you a range of tools that allow you to do a true automatic link exchange or automatic backlinks. 
Just set criteria and system will do everything for you. (If you choose not to use automatic link exchange you can. Or you can choose only to do automatic link exchange with some of your pages. )
*  Read and see video here: http://www.trafficfeed.com/cms/seo-tools-overview/

How to use this plugin?
We have modified the plugin to make it easier to set up and start using.
Plugin will have Trafficfeed widget now which will allow you to drag and drop it. (You can still place
Trafficfeed widget where ever you would like in a post, page, side bar, header, footer etc.)

You can specify what you would like system to display - link window (where links will appear) or a 
link directory (which will allow you to gather partners outside of Trafficfeed network; it comes with a built in form).

::::Option 1 Link Window::::: (recommended)
All exchanges for particular page will display.(only for that page, you can put one link on one page and 2 different links on  another page and system will only display what you have specified)

:::::Option 2 Link Directory:::::
All of the exchanges for your site, will show on a page where you will use this  
short code [TF-SHOW show="receive_dir"] 

Note : You can use short code in text widget or on page or in a post. Just place the  short code and you are done. 
So if you want to place links of your partners inside a  
blog post you can do that.   
Similarly you can place link(s) on page(s) that you choose to.
(VERY USEFUL Not to clutter one page or post with too many links and what ever you  
select to appear from your trafficfeed account will appear on that particular page)
